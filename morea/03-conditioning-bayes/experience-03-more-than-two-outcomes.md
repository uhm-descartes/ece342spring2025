# More Than Two Outcomes

In *Inception*, Dom Cobb (i.e., Leonardo DiCaprio) uses a spinning top to determine if he is in a *dream* or *reality*. However, there is another layer: sometimes he is in a *dream within a dream*.

Suppose that Cobb is in reality 30% of the time, in a normal dream 50% of the time, and in a dream within a dream 20% of the time.
- If Cobb is in reality, the top stops spinning 90% of the time and keeps spinning 10% of the time.
- If Cobb is in a normal dream, the top keeps spinning 80% of the time and stops 20% of the time.
- If Cobb is in a dream within a dream, the top keeps spinning 95% of the time and stops 5% of the time.

Question:
- (2 points) Given that Cobb observes the top still spinning, what is the probability that he is in a dream within a dream?

Please send your solution to me via email. Good luck!
