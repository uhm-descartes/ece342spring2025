# Jurassic Park: Velociraptor Escaping

In *Jurassic Park*, there are two velociraptor enclosures: Enclosure A (smaller, with 3 raptors) and Enclosure B (larger, with 7 raptors). Each raptor in either enclosure has a 5% chance of escaping.

If at least one raptor from an enclosure escapes, the alarm sounds for that enclosure.

Given that at least one escape alarm has gone off, what is the probability that Enclosure A is the one with an escaped raptor?
