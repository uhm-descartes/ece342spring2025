# Star Wars: Detecting a Sith Lord

In Star Wars, the Jedi suspect that a senator is secretly a Sith Lord. However, there are *two possible Sith Lords* hiding among the senators.

Only 2% of all senators are Sith Lords.

The Jedi test for Sith corruption:
- If a senator is a Sith Lord, the test correctly detects them 98% of the time.
- If a senator is not a Sith Lord, the test falsely identifies them as Sith 3% of the time.

A senator tests positive for Sith corruption. What is the probability that this senator is actually a Sith Lord, given that there are two Sith Lords among them?
