# Set Algebra With Three Sets

Among 200 students in the ECE department, 100 students like hiking ($H$), 80 students like surfing ($S$), and 70 students like camping ($C$). In addition, 50 students like both hiking and surfing, 40 students like both surfing and camping, 30 students like both hiking and camping, and 20 students like all three activities.

Using $H$, $S$, $C$, and set algebras (complement, intersection, union), represent the following sets and calculate the number of students in each set.

- Set of students who like at least one of these three activities.

- Set of students who like only one of these activities.

- Set of students who like exactly two of these activities.

Please send your solution to me via email. Good luck!
