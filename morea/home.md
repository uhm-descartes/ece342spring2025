# Welcome to ECE 342 Spring 2025

In ECE 342, we will develop intuitions 💡 on probability and statistics, learn to formulate 📝 real-world scenarios as probability problems, and get your hands dirty with computer simulations 💻.

## Pedagogy

ECE 342 is structured as a sequential series of [modules](/ece342spring2025/modules/), each taking approximately one to two weeks to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Learning outcomes](/ece342spring2025/outcomes/), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/ece342spring2025/readings/), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/ece342spring2025/experiences/), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material (and **extra credits** ✨).

## Useful Resources

  * 📖 Textbooks
    - [Introduction to Probability by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis](https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/probbook.html)
  * 🗓 [Course calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AmW5i9hfhRHsJT5VinAyVdSmnN73MGWisNbjJ3jjPQE/edit?usp=sharing).
  * 🤖 [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AXjmP3gVyS).
  * 📜 [Anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/c3HNjqfjsTCNcpBj6).
  * 💻 Software and simulation:
    - Python -- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (may have issues if you log in Google using your UH email)
